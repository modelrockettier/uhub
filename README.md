# Uhub

Uhub is a high performance peer-to-peer hub for the ADC network. Its low memory footprint allows it to handle several thousand users on high-end servers, or a small private hub on embedded hardware.

Uhub uses the ADC protocol, and is compatible with DC++, jUCy and other ADC clients.

## Key features

 - High performance and low memory usage
 - IPv4 and IPv6 support
 - Experimental SSL support (optional)
 - Advanced access control support
 - Easy configuration
